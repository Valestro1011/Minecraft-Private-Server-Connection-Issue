1. Anti Virus Software
    - My friends Mcafee antivirus was blocking him from connecting
2. Changing my DNS settings for my wifi/ethernet allowed me to connect
    - Control Panel -> Netword and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Connections: wifi/ethernet -> Properties -> IPV4
    - change DNS Server addresses to use Preferred: 8.8.8.8 and Alternative: 8.8.4.4
